# Contributing & Task Division

Suggested split for a 4-person group:
- Member 1: Owner - create repo, upload codigo-original and codigo-refatorado, manage PRs, final push.
- Member 2: Code - improve code, add converters, refactor and document.
- Member 3: Tests & CI - expand tests, create GitHub Actions workflow to run pytest.
- Member 4: Documentation & Presentation - write report, create slides, speaker notes.

Each member must make at least one commit with meaningful message. Use the suggested messages in CHANGELOG.
